How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to make sure that my code, program, or software works well and stays safe, I focus on testing.
Following security best practices right from the start of development.
By including unit tests like the ones found in ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java, I proactively fixed issues at the beginning stage of development.
These tests, combined with security evaluations, are elements of my approach to creating strong and secure applications.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding what the user needs and integrating those needs into a program requires a grasp of the user's situation and the issues they want to address
through the software. This understanding of the objectives of a project directs how I design and develop, making sure that functionalities are similar to those
I did in my ContactService.java file are focused on the user effectively meeting real-life requirements in an intuitive manner.

How do I approach designing software?

When I create software, I take a user-focused approach. I begin by defining what the users need. Then I design software structures that can adapt and grow,
similar to how Contact.java is set up. This method allows me to tweak and adjust the software as user requirements change, ensuring that the final product is
effective and meets user expectations. Reflecting on these projects has shown me how vital it is to have a user-centered strategy in software development. It
has emphasized the roles of testing and security in building software and reminded me to stay flexible and responsive to user needs throughout the design
process. This reflection does not solidify my knowledge. It also equips me to talk about and showcase these skills in future professional settings, using my
portfolio as a tangible demonstration of my abilities and methods.
